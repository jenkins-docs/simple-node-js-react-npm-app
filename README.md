# simple-node-js-react-npm-app

This repository is for the
[Using Jenkins to build a Node.js and React application with npm](https://jenkins.io/doc/tutorials/building-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm/)
tutorial in the [Jenkins User Documentation](https://jenkins.io/doc/).

The repository contains a simple Node.js and React application which generates
a web page with the content "Welcome to React" and is accompanied by a test to
check that the application renders satisfactorily.

The `jenkins` directory contains an example of the `Jenkinsfile` (i.e. Pipeline)
you'll be creating yourself during the tutorial and the `scripts` directory
contains shell scripts with commands that are executed when Jenkins processes
the "Deliver" stage of your Pipeline.
